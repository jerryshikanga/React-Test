# React-Test

I used yarn and not npm to setup the react environment. So it would be better to install yarn and do yarn install to get the node modules. Then do yarn start at the project root to start the server. Kisha localhost:3000 kama kawaida.
Most of the files and layouts are autogenerated so for now you'll only have to look at App.js and App.css
All the best
